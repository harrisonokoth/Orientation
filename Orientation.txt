[Annebelle Wafula] 11:36:38
Okay. And, now I'll just take us through the community. And I think I mentioned earlier the community is for I think a whole some experience in your learning journey so I know you have had a say about the events that events that will happen during the course of your program.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:36:58
So most of this will be in terms of interacting with the community and the community is basically you, you being part of the program, you already part of the community.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:37:09
So you don't have had someone ask me if. Someone needs to pay to be part of the community know you being a learner automatically gives you that advantage.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:37:16
And you'll be able to interact with other developers just like yourself. I also see a lot of women here.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:37:25
We have very great initiatives in the community. For the women in tech. And most of you with the projects that you did that you curate during the session you'll be able to become setup founders and actually get to learn about some of the success stories that we've heard.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:37:46
People came into the program and then they developed projects and startups and now they're making money out of it.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:37:54
So you listen to a guy called Jeffett. And he'll take you through his experience in just a bit.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:38:00
So in the community, we focus on 3 key pillars. We have the personal growth. We have wellness and collaboration for impact.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:38:09
So in terms of personal growth, you may have had this already, but we do master classes in collaboration with the Land Experience Department.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:38:37
Actually it was yesterday the day before. We have done digital skills, master classes. In the next month, we are about to do one in cybersecurity and just about mental health.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:38:47
Which is so important in this journey that you'll be taking. We also have wellness. Isaac mentioned about a section in terms of How our game is.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:39:00

Over the weekend and this is just to ensure that you are not stuck behind your laptop the entire time you also get to interact outside and build your networks and become potential to your health in that sense.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:40:27
Collaboration for impact. This has been said, but it's our power hacks. So you have heard about Hakatones in boot camp.

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:40:37

[Annebelle Wafula] 11:41:00
And even in terms of marine solution. So there's a lot that we will do. In fact, on the call, we have a winner from one of our most recent power hacks.
